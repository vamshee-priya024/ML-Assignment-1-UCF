Is the data preprocessing process proposed in the Kaggle post the best preprocessing solution? If yes, please explain why. If not, can you leverage what you learned in the class and your previous experiences to improve data processing, to obtain better accuracies for all these classification models? Describe what is your improved data preprocessing, and what are your improved accuracies? 

The data preprocessing process proposed in given Kaggle post consists of handling null values ,analysis on correlation , introducing new columns such as Age * Class, dropping unwanted columns. From the previous experience and information gained from our classes, I have figured out that handling outliers in data preprocessing and normalization of training data  could help us improve the accuracy and develop better classification models. In ‘Age’ and ‘Fare’ columns , outliers are found , thus removal of the outliers is performed.
